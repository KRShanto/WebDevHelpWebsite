# WebDevHelp

A website where people can ask their questions related to web development and get help from others.

This project is a collaboration with some of Bangladeshi web developers.

*Everyone* is welcome to contribute to this project even if you are not a Bangladeshi.

This project is a **community project**. So we are not going to pay anyone for contributing to this project.

It is a Bangladeshi website. So the language of the website will be in Bangla. But if you are a foreigner and you want to contribute to this project, then we can also talk in English.

## Why this project?

There are lots of websites where people can ask their questions and get help from others. But most of them are not **Bangladeshi**. So we thought that we should create a website where people can ask their questions in their own language.

This project is mainly for collaboration. It will help both advanced and beginners to learn new things. It will help us to work together and build something great.

## What we are building?

The website is much similar to **Discord** where people can join different channels and ask their questions.

We are also building a **bot** system where the bot will try to search the errors and share the link.
